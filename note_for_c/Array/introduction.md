Variables are great for storing and working with values. But what if we need to store multiple similar values? For example, ages of a group a people.

Instead of creating separate variables for each person, we can use an array to store all values!



  
An array needs to be declared like a variable, with the type of the items it will hold.

**For example:**

```C
int ages[7];
```
