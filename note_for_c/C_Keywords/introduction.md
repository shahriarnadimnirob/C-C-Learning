# keyword introduction

Keywords are those predefined words that have 
special meaning in the compiler and they cannot be used for any other purpose. As per the C99 standard, C language has 32 keywords. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

The following table has the list of all keywords (reserved words) available in the C language:

| auto    | double  | int     | struct   |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| break   | else    | long    | switch   |
| case    | enum    | register| typedef  |
| char    | extern  | return  | union    |
| continue| for     | signed  | void     |
| do      | if      | static  | while    |
| default | goto    | sizeof  | volatile |
| const   | float   | short   | unsigned |


All the keywords in C have lowercase alphabets, although the keywords that have been newly added in C, do have uppercase alphabets in them. C is a case-sensitive language. Hence, int is a keyword but INT, or Int are not recognized as a keyword. The new keywords introduced from C99 onwards start with an underscore character. The compiler checks the source code for the correctness of the syntax of all the keywords and then translates it into the machine code.

These keywords can be broadly classified in following types âˆ’
-
- Primary Data types
- User defined types
- Storage types
- Conditionals
- Loops and loop controls
- Others
