# Learning C and C++

This repository contains my journey of learning **C** and **C++** programming from scratch.
It includes small programs, practice exercises, and notes as I explore the fundamentals of these languages.

## ðŸ“š Contents

* **Basic Syntax** â€“ Hello World, variables, data types, operators
* **Control Flow** â€“ if/else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)
* **Functions** â€“ function definitions, parameters, return values
* **Arrays & Strings** â€“ manipulation, input/output, common operations
* **Pointers & Memory** â€“ pointer basics, dynamic memory allocation
* **Structures & Classes** â€“ C structs, C++ classes and objects
* **Object-Oriented Programming (C++)** â€“ encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
* **Practice Programs** â€“ mini-projects and problem-solving

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

* **Language:** C, C++
* **Compiler:** GCC / G++
* **Editor/IDE:** (Add your editor, e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
3. Compile a file:

   * For C:

     ```bash
     gcc filename.c -o output
     ./output
     ```
   * For C++:

     ```bash
     g++ filename.cpp -o output
     ./output
     ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

* Strengthen my fundamentals in C and C++
* Practice problem-solving through coding exercises
* Explore advanced C++ features after mastering basics

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This repo is mainly for personal learning, but feel free to explore or suggest improvements.
